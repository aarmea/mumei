Level 1-0: variable assignment

Use the arrow keys to move around the editor.
Press Alt+[arrow key] to move your character.

The goal of these levels is to stop the robot
at the door and change its eye color to match
the color on the door.

Notice that the robot is already at the door.

You can assign variables with this syntax:
  [variable] = [value];

So to set a variable named x to 5, do:
  x = 5;

Every C program needs a main() function, which
is where the program starts when it is run.
We're starting you off with one.

Press F5 to run your code.
