Level 1-3: going up and system calls

The door is not on the ground anymore.
The robot will need to climb the ladder.

When the robot is at a ladder, setting
the dir variable to 3 or 4 will move it
up or down.

The wait(n) function makes the robot wait
for about n seconds.

So to make the robot wait 5 seconds, do:
  wait(5);

  /* Insert your code here */

  return 0;
